Title: Clickbait Headline Detector
Welcome to the Clickbait Headline Detector project.

This project uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning to identify whether a news headline is clickbait or not. We trained and compared multiple models like Logistic Regression, LSTM, and BERT, and built a user-friendly Streamlit web app where you can simply input a headline and instantly see the prediction.

Project Highlights:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned headlines using stopword removal, lemmatization, and punctuation cleanup.

Model Training:
Logistic Regression for lightweight predictions.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to capture sequential word patterns.
BERT (Transformer Model) for deep contextual understanding.
Evaluation: We measured Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for all models.
Streamlit Dashboard: Choose between Logistic Regression, LSTM, and BERT to predict clickbait vs. non-clickbait headlines.
